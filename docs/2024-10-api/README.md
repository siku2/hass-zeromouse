App Version: 1.13.2.29

## Reverse engineering the App

1. Download APK from apkpure
2. Decompile APK using tool like decompiler.com
3. Notice that the App uses React native and use <https://github.com/P1sec/hermes-dec/> to decompile the assets/index.android.bundle file

The resulting output is not included in this repo because it's way too big. It's also not particularly readable but it's useful for extracting constants.
